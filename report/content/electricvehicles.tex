We investigate the differences and similarities of two electric vehicles: the Nissan Leaf and Tesla's S model. 
One of the reasons why we have chosen these two cars in particular is the fact that both of the cars, today, 
are among the most popular electric vehicles. We investigate the range, charging options, charging times, 
battery capacity and other factors which may be relevant when calculating the fastest path between two points for 
electric vehicles.

\subsection{The Range}

The range of an electric vehicles depends on many factors, such as: the battery capacity, how efficient the battery
is used, the speed which is driven at, the drag of the car, the wind resistance, how much air conditioning is 
used etc. The two most important factors, though, are the battery capacity and the speed which is driven at. 
Tesla's S model comes with different battery sizes. We choose to focus on the Tesla S model with 85 kWh which is 
the biggest battery size but it also comes in a 60 kWh variant. The Nissan Leaf comes with a 24 kWh battery. The 
Nissan Leaf is said to have 120 km EPA rated range. EPA stands for Environmental Protection Agency
