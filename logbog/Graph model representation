Graph model representation:

Vertices: Road intersections
Edges: Roads

Weights: A tuple of 1) Energy modification to traverse the edge and 2) The time it takes to travel

Negative energy is consumption (driving)
Positive energy is charging

Loops with a tuple of positive energy and time it takes to charge represents, a charging station
