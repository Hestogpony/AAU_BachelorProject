The limitations of electric vehicles in 2014:

	Nissan Leaf:
		Range: 100-150 km on a full charged battery
		Top speed: 144 km/h
		Battery size: 24 kWh
		Recharging time:
			Home: 6-7 hours
			Turbo-charger: 25-30 minutes for a 80 % charged battery
		Price: 253.690,- kr. (With battery and installation)
	
	Recharging times in general:
		Depends very much on the battery size and the country you live in, but some approximate numbers:
			Level 1 station: 15 hours for 0 to 100 % (120 volts, 15 to 20 amps)
			Level 2 station: 4 hours for 0 to 100 % (240 volts, 30 amps)
			Level 3 station: 30 minutes for 0 to 80 % (480 volts, 125 amps):
				There are two different and competing standards for level 3 stations: J1772 Combo ports and CHAdeMO ports
				The limitation of only recharging to 80 % is done to prevent the battery from being damaged.
	
		Tesla S-models:
		
			Level 1 Tesla station: 88 hours for 0 to 100 % (120 volts) 
			Level 2 Tesla station: 8,5 hours for 0 to 100 % (240 volts)
			Level 3 Tesla station: 1 hour for 0 to 100 %
