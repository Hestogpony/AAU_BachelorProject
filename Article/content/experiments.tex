\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
This section presents the experiments of the greedy heuristic algorithm. Our linear programming solution was test implemented with GLPK, but the practical usage of it was not found plausible, due to overwhelming running times. Further experiments were therefore omitted. We test the performance of the greedy heuristic algorithm in comparison to a naive algorithm, which is presented in section \ref{sub:naivealgorithm}. We have constructed four experiments, to figure out what implication the adjusting of parameters will have on the greedy heuristic Algorithm. The four parameters being experimented on are:

\begin{itemize}
     \item Driving distance
     \item Charge rate on charging stations
     \item Consumption rate of the EV
     \item Density of charging stations in the road network
 \end{itemize} 

In addition, the runtime complexity of the algorithms will be tested and analysed.
