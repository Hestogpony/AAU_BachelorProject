\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
This section presents the experiments for the greedy heuristic algorithm. Our linear programming solution was implemented, such that we can test the quality of the greedy choices. We chose not to use LP along with Dijkstras algorithm, because it was too slow. We compare the performance of the greedy heuristic to a naive algorithm, which is presented in section \ref{sub:naivealgorithm}, on five experiments. The experiments have been selected to illustrate the effects from variables in the route planning problem, including: route distance to drive, charge rate on charging stations, consumption rate of the EV, density of charging stations in the road network and the input size.

The default settings for all the experiments are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
     \item Route distance: $300 \si{km}$
     \item Charge rates: randomly generated between $10-100 \si{kW}$
     \item EV consumption rate: $0.019v^2-0.77v+184.4$ $\si{Wh\per km}$, where $v$ is the speed (corresponds approximately to Tesla's Model S\cite{teslacon})
     \item EV battery capacity: 50 $\si{kWh}$
	 \item EV initial battery: 50 $\si{kWh}$
     \item Density of charging stations: minimum distance of $20 \si{km}$ between each charging station)
 \end{itemize} 

The route distance, consumption rate and battery capacity is chosen to force the EV to charge in most cases. The charging station density is chosen to have a reliable infrastructure, with an even spread of charging stations. In the default settings we have 326 stations, when in fact Denmark have more than 4000\cite{Globalevoutlook}. 

We have used the drivable part of Denmark as a baseline for the experiments. The dataset features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 483407 vertices
    \item 543482 edges
\end{itemize}
