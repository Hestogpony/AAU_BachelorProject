\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
This section presents the experiments for the greedy heuristic algorithm. Our linear programming solution was implemented with GLPK as a test, but the practical usage of it was not found plausible, due to overwhelming running times. Further experiments were therefore omitted. We compare the performance of the greedy heuristic to a naive algorithm, which is presented in section \ref{sub:naivealgorithm}, on five experiments. The experiments have been selected to illustrate the effects from variables in the route planning problem, including: route distance to drive, charge rate on charging stations, consumption rate of the EV, density of charging stations in the road network and the input size.
\todo[inline]{revise this intro so it correspond to what we acctaully do}

To show the effect of the different parameters, we a default setting for all the experiments. The settings are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
     \item Route distance to drive: $300 \si{km}$
     \item Charge rates on charging stations: randomly generated between $10-100 \si{kW}$
     \item EV consumption rate: $0.019v^2-0.77*v+184.4$ $\si{Wh\per km}$, where $v$ is the speed (corresponds approximately to Tesla's Model S\cite{teslacon})
     \item EV max battery capacity: 50 $\si{kWh}$
	 \item EV initial battery: 50 $\si{kWh}$
     \item Density of charging stations: minimum distance of $20 \si{km}$ between each charging station)
 \end{itemize} 

The route distance, consumption rate and battery capacity is chosen to force the EV to charge in most cases. The charging station density is chosen to have a reliable infrastructure, with an even spread of charging stations. In the base case we have 326 stations, when in fact Denmark have more than 4000\cite{Globalevoutlook}. The average charge rate is presumably a lot lower in reality, as very few charging stations are fast chargers.

We have used the drivable part of Denmark as a baseline for the experiments. The dataset features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 483407 vertices
    \item 543482 edges
\end{itemize}
