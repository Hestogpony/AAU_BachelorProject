\begin{abstract}
We describe a greedy-heuristic route planning algorithm for electric vehicles, this algorithm uses parameters about both the road network and the vehicle itself, to find a time efficient route plan between two points. We further introduce a linear programming method, which combined with the greedy-heuristic algorithm, can improve effectiveness and efficiency at the cost of computation time. Unlike the most common of today's navigation systems, the presented greedy-heuristic algorithm takes both the driving time and recharge time into account. This is a necessity as the recharging infrastructure is still limited, both in terms of the number of charge stations and their charge rates.\\

We compare the performance of the greedy-heuristic algorithm, with a naive algorithm which is built to mimic the refuel pattern, when using a combustion engine vehicle. A roadnetwork extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) is used to benchmark these two algorithms on multiple problem variations; the density of charge stations in the road network, the charge rate of the charge stations, the route length which is to planned, and the size of the input measured in number of nodes.
