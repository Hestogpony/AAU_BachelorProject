\begin{abstract}
We describe a greedy-heuristic algorithm for finding the fastest path, between two points in a
large road network graph, for electrical vehicles. We further introduce a linear programming 
approach, which could be combined with the greedy-heuristic algorithm and likely improve fastest path 
finding abilities at the cost of run time performance. Unlike many of today's GPS systems, our greedy-heuristic 
algorithm takes both the drive time and the recharge time into account. Since the recharging possibilities for 
electrical vehicles are still limited on Danish roads and the recharging process takes a long time compared to refuelling 
times of regular gasoline cars, this is necessary in order to give the electrical vehicles users a 
useful route plan.\\

We compared the performance of the greedy-heuristic algorithm with a naive algorithm on road
networks extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM). We modified the OSM road network, so it contained Danish speed limits
and charge stations at variable positions and with variable charge rates. We compared the performance of the algorithms 
with four different parameters: the density of charge stations in the road network, the quality of the charge stations 
in the road network, the size of the road network measured in distance and the complexity of the road network measured 
in number of nodes. HOW DID IT PERFORM?!
