We describe a greedy heuristic route planning algorithm that compute time-optimised paths in a road network,
for electric vehicles (EVs). In the future EVs will play an increasingly important role in the traffic and due to the 
limited recharging possibilities, as well as long recharging time of EVs, the requirement for a different routing system emerges. Unlike many of today's navigation systems, the greedy heuristic algorithm presented in this paper takes both the drive time and the recharge time into account. We further introduce a Linear Programming (LP) approach, which can be combined with the greedy heuristic algorithm to compute a faster path, at the cost of computation time.

We compare the performance of the greedy heuristic algorithm with a naive algorithm on a road
network extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The road network contains all Danish roads and speed limits. We modify the road network with charging stations at various positions and charge rates. We compare the performance of the algorithms 
on multiple experiments, which shows us.....
