\begin{abstract}
We describe a greedy-heuristic algorithm for finding the fastest path, between two points in a
large road network graph, for electrical vehicles. Unlike many of today's GPS systems, our greedy-heuristic 
algorithm takes both the drive time and the recharge time into account. Since the recharging possibilities for 
electrical vehicles are still limited on Danish roads and the recharging process takes a long time compared to 
refuelling times of regular gasoline cars, this is necessary in order to give the electrical vehicles users a 
useful route plan.\\

We compared the performance of the greedy-heuristic algorithm with a naive algorithm on road
networks extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM). We modified the OSM road network, so it contained Danish speed limits
and charge stations. We compared the performance on four different parameters: the density of charge stations in
the road network, the quality of the charge stations in the road network, the size of the road network measured in 
distance and the complexity of the road network measured in number of nodes. The greedy-algorithm 
performed pretty god damn okay
