\subsection{Test: Running Time}

We compared the run-time of the greedy heuristic algorithm to the run-time of Dijstra's algorithm, with the complexity of the road network as changing parameter. The complexity is measured in the number of vertices on the road network. The more vertices on the road network, the more vertices the two algorithms has to visit before they are able to find a fastest path. The set-up of the experiment: distance to drive was 100 km, the minimum distance between charging stations was 20 km. The initial number of vertices in the road network: 450000 vertices. The number of vertices is then counted down with 10000 for each iteration of the test. The resulting graph is illustrated in (REF!).
