\subsection{Naive algorithm}
\label{sub:naivealgorithm}
We have formulated a naive algorithm for comparison with our greedy heuristic algorithm. The naive algorithm should simulate the way a naive electric vehicle driver would choose to travel through a road network. The naive algorithm works the following way: It greedily follows the fastest path in terms of distance divided by speed. Whenever the battery reaches 40 \% battery capacity, it starts searching for nearby charging stations in the radius allowed by the 40 \% battery capacity given the vehicle's consumption rate. If no charging stations are available with 40 \% battery capacity, the path from $s$ to $t$ is not solvable for the naive algorithm. If, on the other hand, one or more charging stations are reachable, the algorithm will choose the closest one and charge to 100 \% battery capacity or to the battery capacity needed in order to reach $t$. After charging, the algorithm will resume greedily choosing the fastest roads from the charging station to $t$, in terms of distance divided by speed.
