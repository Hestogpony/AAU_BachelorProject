\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relatedwork}
To the best of our knowledge, there is no directly related research to the fastest path problem for electrical vehicles, which is the focus of this article. The fastest path problem is an instance of the constrained shortest path problem, which there are many applications of. There is a lot of work on the shortest path problem, mainly Dijkstra's algorithm \cite{dijkstra1959note} which is an interesting approach to the general shortest path problem.\\

Another relevant constrained shortest path problem, in the domain of electric vehicles, is working with energy-optimal routing, instead of the fastest path \cite{artmeier2010shortest}.\\

Lastly, many commercial navigation services, introduce hierarchical substructures to perform the shortest path computation faster. This is known as contraction hierarchies, it is a concept which could also be applied to the approach introduced in this article, it is however not the main concern of research. It is mostly a speed-up technique for shortest path computation.
