\section{The Road-network Model}

The road-network used for fisse experimentation is extracted
from Open Street Maps (OSM) and converted into a more suitable 
graph representation. Our graph representation consists 
of edges which represents roads and vertices which represents 
either charge stations or road intersections. A road is 
a double of distance (km), $d$, and speed limit (km/h), 
$V_{lim}$:

\[E(V_i, V_j) = \{d, V_{lim}\} \]

Where $V_i$ and $V_j$ are adjacent vertices. A vertex is a 
single of charge rate (kWh/h), $R_{charge}$:

\[V = \{R_{charge}\} \]

A road intersection is simply a vertex with $R_{charge} = 0$
while a charge station is a vertex where $R_{charge} > 0$. 
An electrical vehicle is specified by two parameters: It's 
battery capacity (kWh), consumption rate (kWh/km). The 
consumption rate is given by the following function:

\[ 4,60272*10^{-5}*v^2+6,59187*10^{-4}*v+0,173117 \]

where $v$ is the speed of the vehicle.
