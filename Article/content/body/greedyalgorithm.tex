\subsection{Greedy Algorithm}

The time spent getting from $u_1$ to $u_2$, an edge in the graph, is given by the following equation:

\[T(v,(u_1, u_2)) = \frac{D(u_1, u_2)}{v} + \frac{CS(v) * D(u_1, u_2) - B_{cur}}{CH(u_1)}\]

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[]
\addplot[draw=red]{(50/x)+((0.01*(x^2)+x+10)*100)/40};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}


where $v$ is the speed of the vehicle, $D(u_1, u_2)$ is the distance between $u_1$ and $u_2$, 
$CS(v)$ is the consumption rate of the vehicle at the speed $v$, $B_{cur}$ is the current battery
of the vehicle and $CH(u_1)$ is the charge rate of charge station $u_1$. The above equation yields 
a function on the form: $av^2 + bv + c$, due to the fact that $\textbf{CS}$ is a quadratic function, 
where a, b and c are some constants. Represented in a coordinate system, this becomes a curve as 
represented in figure X. On the x-axis is the speed of the vehicle and on the y-axis is the time 
spent passing the road. 

The turning point of the graph, $v_{opt}($e$)$, is the optimal speed to drive at, 
in order to pass the road fastest. The following function describes the speed which should be used, depending on the speed limits of $e$, $v_{min}(e)$ and $v_{max}(e)$.

\[ T(v, e) = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l l}
    v_{max}(e) & \qquad \text{if $v_{opt}(e) \geq v_{max}(e)$}\\
    v_{opt}(e) & \qquad \text{if $v_{min}(e) \geq v_{opt}(e) \geq v_{max}(e)$}\\
    v_{min}(e) & \qquad \text{if $v_{opt}(e) \leq v_{min}(e)$}
  \end{array} \right\} \]
