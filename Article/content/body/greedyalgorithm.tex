\subsection{Greedy Algorithm}

The time to pass a road, $(u_1, u_2)$, is given by the following equation:

\[T(v,(u_1, u_2)) = \frac{D(u_1, u_2)}{v} + \frac{CS(v) * D(u_1, u_2) - B_{cur}}{CH(u_1)}\]

where $v$ is the speed of the vehicle, $D(u_1, u_2)$ is the distance between $u_1$ and $u_2$, 
$CS(v)$ is the consumption rate of the vehicle at the speed $v$, $B_{cur}$ is the current battery
of the vehicle and $CH(u_1)$ is the charge rate of charge station $u_1$. The above equation yields 
a function on the form: $av^2 + bv + c$, due to the fact that $\textbf{CS}$ is a quadratic function, 
where a, b and c are some constants. Represented in a coordinate system, this becomes a curve as 
represented in figure X. On the x-axis is the speed of the vehicle and on the y-axis is the time 
spent passing the road. The turning point of the graph, $v_{opt}(e)$, is the optimal speed to drive at, 
in order to pass the road fastest. If the speed limit of the road is below $v_{opt}(e)$ the car should 
drive with the speed limit as it's speed, if the  

\[ T(v, e) = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l l}
    v_{max}(e) & \qquad \text{if $v_{opt}(e) \geq v_{max}(e)$}\\
    v_{opt}(e) & \qquad \text{if $v_{min}(e) \geq v_{opt}(e) \geq v_{max}(e)$}\\
    v_{min}(e) & \qquad \text{if $v_{opt}(e) \leq v_{min}(e)$}
  \end{array} \right\} \]
