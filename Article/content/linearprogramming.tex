\subsection{Approximating an Optimal Path}\label{sec:LP}
In this section an approach to finding an approximately optimal solution to the optimisation problem proposed in the previous section is formulated. As mentioned, the optimisation problem is a non-linear optimisation problem, due to the distance divided by speed, \( D(e_i)/v_{e_i} \), and the consumption rate of EVs, $R_{CO}(v_{e_i})$, are non-linear functions. However, these functions can be used in a linear programming problem by formulating \( D(e_i)/v_{e_i} \) and $R_{CO}(v_{e_i})$ as piece-wise linear functions \cite{ahuja1995capacity}. Specifically, the problem is modelled as a mixed integer problem (MIP) problem. This section introduces the extra constraints necessary to solve the problem as a MIP problem and thereby end up at an approximately optimal solution \cite{piecewiseglpk}. The quality of the solution depends on how many pieces the non-linear function is split into.

The linearization of a function is handled as shown in Figure \ref{fig:linearization_example}. The non-linear function is split into a number of linear line segments. To handle the linearization three new sets are introduced: a set of known variables which is the precomputed function of each linear line segment, and another set of known variables which is the start and end points of each line segment and a set of unknown variables which will be the line segment chosen. The unknown variable is called selected line, SL, which has a two dimensional size $n \times m$ where $n$ is the amount of edges with a unique function. $m$ is the number of linear lines every edge's function is split into. This leads to the following constraints:  

For n edges, exactly n line segments needs to be selected. In other words, for every edge only one linear line is chosen. 
\begin{equation*}
\forall_{i\in1 \dots n }:\; \sum_{j=1}^{m} SL_{i,j} = 1
\end{equation*}
$\sum_{j=1}^{m} SL_{i,j} = 1$ ensures that only one line segments can be selected, because exactly one line segment needs to be chosen. In other words, $SL$ needs to be binary:
\begin{equation*}
\forall_{i\in1 \dots n, j \in 1 \dots m}: \; \; SL_{i,j} \in{0,1} 
\end{equation*}
Because we now have $m$ points describing each line, we need $m$ values for each $v_{e_i}$. Thus $v_{e_i}$ is extended with an additional index parameter to handle this additional dimension. The speed of the EV needs to be constrained by the start and ending point of the selected line segment:
\begin{equation*}
\forall_{i\in1 \dots n, j \in 1 \dots m-1}:\; SL_{i,j} \times P_{i,j}  \le  v_{e_i,j} \le SL_{i,j}\times P_{i,j+1}
\end{equation*}
$P$ is the set of starting points for all line segments. $P_{i,j}$ is the starting point of the $j^{\text{th}}$ line segment for the $i^{\text{th}}$ edge, $P_{i,j+1}$ is the ending point of the $j^{\text{th}}$ line segment and it is also the starting point of the $(j+1)^{\text{th}}$ line segment. $SL_{i,j} \times P_{i,j}$ is the minimal speed the EV is allowed to drive on edge $i$ and $SL_{i,j}\times P_{i,j+1}$ is the maximal speed. Note that the values will either be a valid value or $0$, if the segment is not selected. 

To linearize $R_{CO}(v_{e_i})$ we precompute a set of line functions on the form $ax+b$. We store the slope $a$ as $Slopes$, and the constants $b$ as $Constants$. In total $n \times m$ function are defined. The linearized model of $R_{CO}(v_{e_i})$ for every edge $i$ will look like this:
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{j=1}^{m} Slopes_{i,j}\times v_{e_i,j} + \sum_{j=1}^{m} SL_{i,j}\times Constants_{i,j} 
\end{equation*}
$\sum_{j=1}^{m} Slopes_{i,j}\times v_{e_i,j}$ is equivalent to $ax$ and $\sum_{j=1}^{m} SL_{i,j}\times Constants_{i,j}$ is equivalent to $b$. 
Finally note that this is a way to determine the solution of $R_{CO}(v_{e_i})$ and before a solution to a path can be found, the line segments and points for \emph{both} of the non-linear functions needs to be precomputed.
