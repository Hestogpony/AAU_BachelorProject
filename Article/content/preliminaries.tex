\section{Preliminaries} \label{sec:notation}
In this section we explain the mathematical notation and model used in this paper. We further present a brief example of why a shorter path does not necessarily equal a faster path for EVs. 

\subsection{Notation}
The graph representation of a road network consists of edges which represent road segments and vertices which represent either charging stations or road intersections. We define a road network, $RN$, as a tuple $RN=(V,E,D,v_{max},v_{min},R_{ch})$ comprising of a set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of edges. Where $V$ is a finite set and $E$ is a binary relation on $V$. We further define the following functions:
\[ D(e)\rightarrow d \] 
\[ v_{max}(e)\rightarrow v \]
\[ v_{min}(e)\rightarrow v \]
These total functions respectively returns the length of edge $e$, the maximum speed of edge $e$ and the minimum speed of edge $e$. Each vertex is defined as a charging station or a road intersection, described by the following total function:
\[R_{ch}(u)\rightarrow c\]
$c$ is the charging rate of vertex $u$ given in kilo-Watt. A road intersection is simply a vertex with charge rate $c = 0\si{\kW}$, while a charging station is a vertex where $c > 0\si{\kW}$. 

An electric vehicle $EV=(R_{co},B_{cur},B_{cap})$ is a tuple given by three parameters: Its battery capacity $B_{cap}$ given in $\si{\kWh}$, Its consumption rate, $R_{co}$ given in kWh/km. The consumption rate is given by a function on the following form:
\[ R_{co}(v)=av^2+bv+c \]
where $v$ is the speed of the vehicle and the constants $a$, $b$ and $c$ are dependent on the specific instance of the vehicle. The current battery capacity of the vehicle in a given state, $B_{cur}$, is given by three parameters: the starting battery, the energy consumed and the energy charged. Lastly, we define a path $P$ of length k in a graph as a sequence of vertices $\langle u_1,u_2,\dots,u_k \rangle$ and a set of edges $(u_{i},u_{i+1})\in E$ for $i=1,2,\dots,k-1$.

The fastest path problem can now be defined in relation to this notation:

\textbf{Definition 1:} Given a road network $RN=(V,E,D,v_{max},$\\ 
$v_{min},R_{ch})$ and a vehicle $EV=(R_{co},B_{cur},B_{cap})$. The fastest path 
from $s$ to $t$, is defined as the path $P = \langle s,u_1,u_2,\dots,t \rangle$ where the time spent driving and charging is minimal.
