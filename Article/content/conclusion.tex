\section{Conclusions}
As the adoption rate of EVs increases time-optimised route planning systems for electrical vehicles will become increasingly important. 
We showed that a route planning system for EVs should be different from a system for traditional gasoline vehicles, since the time spend 
charging an EV is significantly longer than the time spend fuelling a gasoline vehicle. 

The problem of finding a route plan for an EV can be modelled as an optimisation problem, which can be solved by e.g. a linear programming system. We implemented a linear programming solution using GNU Linear Programming Kit and found that solving every simple path in a graph with the size of a real world road network, is simply too expensive to compute within reasonable time. Instead we presented a greedy heuristic algorithm that uses greedy choices and heuristics about the EV and the road network.

To benchmark the greedy heuristic algorithm we ran several experiments on a real world road network and compared the performance with a naive algorithm that simulated the pattern of a naive electric vehicle driver. The experiments showed that the greedy heuristic algorithm both finds better paths and better charging plans in the road network. The running time is however significantly larger than the naive algorithm.

We further compared the path time outputted by the greedy heuristic algorithm to the path time of the linear programming solution when run on the same path.
