\section{Conclusions}
We show that a route plan for EVs is different from traditional gasoline vehicle, as the time spend charging is much larger than the time spend fuelling a gasoline vehicle. The problem of finding a route plan for an EV can be modelled as an optimisation problem for paths, which in turn can be solved by a linear program. However solving every simple path in a graph with the size of a real world road network, is simply to expensive to compute within a reasonable amount of time. To solve the route planning problem for a graph, we present an algorithm that uses greedy choices and heuristics about the EV and the road network.\\
To benchmark this greedy heuristic algorithm we ran several experiments, comparing the route plans with a naive algorithm that mimics a simple refuelling pattern. The experiments showed that the greedy heuristic approach finds both better paths and better charging plans for in the road network. The running time is however significantly larger than the naive algorithm, as the edge weight function and information about charge station.
