\section{Fastest Path}
\label{sec:fastestpath}
As we showed in Section \ref{sec:shorternotfaster}, finding the fastest path for an EV, from vertex $s$ to $t$ in a road network, does not only depend on the lengths and speed limits of the road network's edges but also on the charge rates of its vertices. In this section we will focus on solving an arbitrary path. We first describe the path optimization problem in Section \ref{sec:optiprob}. Then we use this to arrive at an approximating optimal solution in Section \ref{sec:LP} and finally we present another way to solve a path using a greedy heuristic in Section \ref{sec:greedy}. When we are able to solve a path, we will concern ourselves with a full graph in Section \ref{sec:algo}
