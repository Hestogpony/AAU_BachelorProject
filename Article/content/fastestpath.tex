\section{Fastest Path}

As we showed in \Cref{sec:shorternotfaster}, finding the fastest path for an EV, from vertex $s$ to $t$ in a road network, does not only depend on the lengths and speed limits of the road network's edges but also on the charge rates of it's vertices. In this section we first describe this path-optimization problem in section \ref{sec:optiprob}. Then we go on to the globally optimal solution in section \ref{sec:LP} and finally we present a greedy heuristic path optimizing algorithm in section \ref{sec:greedy}.
