\section{Fastest Path}

Finding the fastest path for an EV, from vertex $s$ to $t$ in a road network, does not only depend on the lengths and speed limits of the road network's edges but also on the charge rates of it's vertices. We showed this in \Cref{sec:shorternotfaster}. This problem issues that a different approach needs to be taken, in order to solve a path fastest possible. In this section, we present a greedy heuristic algorithm for solving the fastest path problem.
