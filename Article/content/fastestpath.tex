\section{Fastest Path}

Finding the fastest path for an EV, from vertex $s$ to $t$ in a road network, does not only depend on the lengths and speed limits of the road network's edges but also on the charge rates of it's vertices as shown in \Cref{sec:shorternotfaster}. This section introduces two way to determine how a path is optimally driven.
