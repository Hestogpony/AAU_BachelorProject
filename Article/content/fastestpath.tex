\section{Fastest Path}
\label{sec:fastestpath}
As shown in Section \ref{sec:shorternotfaster}, finding the fastest path for an EV does not only depend on the lengths and speed limits of the road network's edges, but also on the charge rates of its vertices. In this section we will focus on solving an arbitrary simple path. We first describe the path optimisation problem in Section \ref{sec:optiprob}. Then we use this to arrive at an approximately optimal solution for a path in Section \ref{sec:LP} and finally we propose a different way to solve a simple path using a greedy heuristic choice in Section \ref{sec:greedy}. Later, we will concern ourselves with solving an entire road network in Section \ref{sec:algo}
