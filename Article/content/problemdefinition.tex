\subsection{Problem Definition} % (fold)
\label{sub:problem_definition}
We are now ready to define the problem. The problem we are going to solve is defined as follows:

\textbf{Definition 1:}\\
Given a road network \(RN=(V,E,D,v_{max},v_{min},R_{CH})\) and a vehicle $EV=(R_{CO},B_{cur},B_{cap})$. The fastest path from $s$ to $t$, is defined as the path $P = \langle s,u_1,u_2,\dots,t \rangle$ where the time spent driving and charging is minimal.
