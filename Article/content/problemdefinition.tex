\subsection{Problem Definition} % (fold)
\label{sub:problem_definition}
We are now ready to define the problem. The problem we are going to solve is defined as follows:
\begin{newdef}
Given a road network $RN=(V,E,D,v_{max},v_{min},R_{CH})$ and a vehicle $EV=(R_{CO},B_{cur},B_{cap})$. The fastest path from $s$ to $t$, is then defined as the path $P = \langle s,v_1,v_2,\dots,t \rangle$ where the time spent \emph{driving and charging} is minimal.
\end{newdef}
